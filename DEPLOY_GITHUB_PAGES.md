# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your error shows GitHub Pages is trying to use Jekyll (a static site generator), but your website is pure HTML and doesn't need Jekyll.

## Quick Fix (3 Options)

### **Option 1: Disable Jekyll** ‚≠ê EASIEST

1. Add a `.nojekyll` file to your website folder (already created for you)
2. Create a new repository called `slixo-website`
3. Push your website files:

```bash
cd /Users/anantchauhan/slixo_2/salon-booking-app/website
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial website"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Anant1711/slixo-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

4. In GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pages
5. Source: Deploy from branch ‚Üí main ‚Üí root
6. Wait 2-3 minutes
7. Your site: `https://anant1711.github.io/slixo-website/`

### **Option 2: Use GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Website

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: '.'
      
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

Then in repo Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source: GitHub Actions

## Why You Got This Error

Your GitHub Actions workflow expected:
- A `/docs` folder (you have `/website`)
- Jekyll configuration
- SCSS assets

Your website is simpler (just HTML/CSS) and doesn't need any of this!

---

## My Recommendation

**Stop fighting with GitHub Pages. Use Netlify.**

Reasons:
1. Your error shows GitHub Pages adds unnecessary complexity
2. You already have a resume site on GitHub Pages
3. Netlify is designed for exactly this use case
4. 3 minutes vs 15+ minutes of troubleshooting
5. No git commands needed
6. No workflow files needed
7. Just drag & drop

**Time saved: 1+ hour**

## If You Already Created GitHub Repo

No problem! You can:
1. Delete the repo (optional)
2. Or keep it for version control
3. Still deploy to Netlify for hosting

They're independent - you can have code on GitHub and hosting on Netlify.
